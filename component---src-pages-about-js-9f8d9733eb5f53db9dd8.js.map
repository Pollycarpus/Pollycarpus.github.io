Being raised from a multicultural family, having been lived in different cities, and having many friends from diverse cultures make me a flexible, adaptive, and tolerant. \r\n              <br></br><br></br>Anyway, I study computer science because I like math, logical games and riddles since I was little. I started learning programming in my first year of college. Surprisingly I can progress from the basics to more difficult works. Since then my interest in tech world grew and grew. I am very excited to be a software engineer or deal with A.I stuff, but for me it does not matter of programming thing. Basically, solving any real problems with my knowledge is my passion. \r\n              <br></br><br></br>During my time in college, definitely I do not just study. I pushed myself to challenge by joining competitions and experience with some activities and internships. TLDR see my resume to know my journey.\r\n            </blockquote>\r\n            <div className=\"mt-5 sm:mt-8 sm:flex sm:justify-start lg:justify-start\">\r\n              <div className=\"rounded-md shadow\">\r\n                <a\r\n                  className=\"block inline w-full flex items-center justify-center px-8 py-3 border-2 text-sm border-black font-medium rounded-md text-gray-700 bg-white hover:bg-blue-700 hover:text-white hover:border-transparent md:py-4 md:text-lg md:px-10\"\r\n                  href={Resume}>\r\n                  See my resume\r\n                </a>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AboutPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/CV-short-d8b721ccd879d644f1229e15cab0c533.pdf\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/formal_13516081-a902bf10c31d4ce55c0cc72461692cc3.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
